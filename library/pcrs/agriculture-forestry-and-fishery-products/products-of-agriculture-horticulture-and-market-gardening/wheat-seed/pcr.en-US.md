# Wheat Seed for Sowing

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR guides foreground data package construction for cleaned wheat seed intended for sowing, including certified, foundation, registered, or comparable seed classes. It covers seed multiplication, post-harvest seed conditioning, optional seed treatment, packaging, storage, and delivery to the declared gate.

Excluded products are commodity wheat grain for food, feed, starch, ethanol, or trading.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | `pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.products-of-agriculture-horticulture-and-market-gardening.wheat-seed` |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 `01111`, `Wheat, seed` |
| covered_products | cleaned wheat seed intended for sowing, including certified, foundation, registered, or comparable seed classes |
| excluded_products | commodity wheat grain for food, feed, starch, ethanol, or trading |
| representative_product | cleaned and graded wheat sowing seed at declared moisture basis |
| production_route | seed multiplication field plus post-harvest seed conditioning |
| market_state | cleaned, graded, packaged, and optionally treated wheat seed at seed plant gate or regional delivery point |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | cleaned wheat seed for sowing |
| How much | 1 kg |
| How well | declared seed class, treatment status, moisture basis, physical purity, and germination rate |
| How long or cycle | one seed production crop cycle; storage duration declared separately when included |
| reference_flow_link | Reference amount and product flow below |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 kg |
| Reference product flow | Wheat `12da5e7d-9b93-4404-8c7d-08f98bec6238` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | seed class or certification class; treatment status; moisture basis; physical purity; germination rate; geography and declared gate; packaging state |

When constructing a foreground data package, the items listed in `Required qualifiers` must be declared in dataset metadata, process notes, reference flow comment, product description, or an equivalent data package field. Missing required qualifiers make the reference flow definition incomplete for that data package.

Mass is the primary reference flow basis. Seed-count data require thousand-kernel weight or another transparent conversion to mass.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | The reference flow must be expressed as kg cleaned wheat seed for sowing. |
| `seed_count_conversion` | optional seed-count data | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Seed count data may be used only when thousand-kernel weight or another transparent conversion to mass is provided. |
| `fertilizer_n_basis` | nitrogen fertilizer inputs and nitrogen emissions | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Record nitrogen fertilizer as kg product and kg N when nitrogen emissions are calculated. |
| `energy_inventory` | electricity, fuel, and drying energy | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ or kWh | State the energy unit used in each inventory row and preserve enough information for conversion. |
| `packaging_count` | count-based packaging data | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | item | Count-based packaging data must also state bag capacity or mass when packaging material quantities are calculated by mass. |

Seed quality properties are foreground attributes recorded alongside the mass reference flow:

| Attribute | Common unit | Typical range | Source ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Moisture content | percent wet basis | 10-14 percent | `fao-wheat-seed-production` |
| Physical purity | percent by mass | 95-99.9 percent | `fao-wheat-seed-production` |
| Germination rate | percent of seeds | 85-98 percent | `fao-wheat-seed-production`, `umn-small-grain-seeding-rate` |
| Thousand-kernel weight | g/1000 seeds | 25-60 g | `unl-wheat-seeding-rate`, `umn-small-grain-seeding-rate` |
| Seed treatment loading | g active ingredient/kg seed | product-specific |  |

## 5. System Boundary

The default boundary is foreground data collection to the declared gate for wheat seed production:

1. Source seed lot, fertilizer, fuel, electricity, crop protection products, seed treatment chemicals, packaging, and their transport records when they are part of the foreground data package.
2. Field seed multiplication: land preparation, sowing, fertilization, irrigation where applicable, crop protection, field inspections when material, harvesting, and field drying.
3. Seed conditioning: drying, cleaning, grading, testing, treatment, packaging, and storage.
4. Transport to the declared gate when the reference flow is delivered seed.

The foreground data package covers seed production to the declared gate. Downstream wheat cultivation using the seed is described in downstream use metadata when the completed dataset is consumed. Capital goods, land occupation, and land transformation are recorded when the declared data package scope includes them.

This boundary is a data-production abstraction. A declared source seed lot is the reproduction starting condition for the foreground package. The source seed lot carries variety and lot identity; seed biomass formation is represented through field material and elementary flows such as water, nutrients, land use, emissions, and biogenic carbon accounting when declared.

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | source_seed_lot |
| starting_condition_role | identity_and_reproduction_condition |
| product_classification_scope | current CPC 3.0 product category `01111`, `Wheat, seed` |
| recursive_input_rule | input flow in the same product category that causes recursive tracing is recorded as declared starting condition |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | source seed lot disclosure and collection protocol record |
| disclosure | record source seed lot identity, propagation class, mass, moisture basis, treatment status, supplier or source field, and evidence |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

Apply allocation decisions in this order:

1. Avoid allocation by subdividing seed production, screenings, straw management, and reject handling processes.
2. Use substitution only when the displaced product and market are supported by evidence.
3. Use economic allocation when seed, screenings, and straw are all marketable products and price data are reliable.
4. Use mass allocation only as a fallback and disclose the sensitivity.

Rejected seed, screenings, straw, and packaging waste must have declared fates, such as product output, waste treatment, field return, incorporation, feed use, open burning, or another evidenced route.
