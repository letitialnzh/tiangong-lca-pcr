# Animal embryos for breeding

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers viable animal embryos released as breeding material at an embryo collection or production-laboratory gate. In-vivo collection and in-vitro production are separate routes. Species, donor, developmental stage, grade, fresh/chilled/frozen state and handover must be declared. Insect eggs, larvae and chrysalides, unfertilised oocytes sold as such, semen as final product, recipient preparation and embryo-transfer service are excluded. International-trade sanitary controls apply only when the destination and species require them.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `count` | reference product | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | item | Count each accepted embryo once; one item is one viable graded embryo, not a container, oocyte or transfer attempt. |
| `yield` | route transitions | Count | embryo, oocyte | Reconcile raw collection/retrieval, preparation, grading, preservation, reject and release counts by donor and route. |
| `media` | fluids and consumables | Mass or calibrated volume | kg, L | Convert volume to mass only with documented composition and density. |
| `period` | donor and shared services | Time and count | donor-day, h, embryo | Align input, output and asset service periods; retain failed attempts. |
| `accepted_item_count` | reference product and its output card | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | item | The machine unit item is the local representation of the confirmed unit-group reference unit Item(s), with multiplier 1. One item means one quality-accepted viable embryo of the declared species, state, grade and release specification. Preserve native embryo counts in collection records. This count representation does not equate containers, volume, sperm count, oocytes or treatment attempts to accepted goods, and does not establish equivalence across species, states or dose specifications. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. These are final foreground-package contributions, not replacements for stage quantitative references or stage-native unit-process datasets. Retain stage records separately. Compute normalized amount = attributable raw amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final reference-output quantity. Apply normalization exactly once. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Identified managed donor entering a reproductive service period, with purchased semen where actually used and upstream feed, media, energy, cryogen and packaging. |
| starting_condition_role | Managed donor production and embryo-goods preparation, not recipient pregnancy or transfer service. |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 `02420`, viable animal embryos only. |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased embryos of the same category remain traced upstream goods and are never counted as newly produced on site. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Species- and route-compatible feed, semen, media, utilities, treatment and capital-service datasets when actually used. |
| disclosure | Donor, period, route, grade, preservation, gate, rejects, shared assets and attribution. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gate` | all routes | End at quality release in a protected container at the collection/production laboratory; exclude recipient management, transfer, pregnancy and onward distribution. | `un-cpc-3`; `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `route_delta` | managed donor and laboratory | In-vivo recovery yields already fertilised embryos; in-vitro retrieval yields oocytes, then requires semen, fertilisation and culture. The routes differ in topology, media, energy, yield and testing; use one route per lot or partition a mixed facility. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `interfaces` | biological production through grading | Record donor management separately from recovery/retrieval, raw material separately from first washing/culture, then accepted, independently downgraded, held and rejected states with handoffs. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `state` | optional preservation | Fresh lots bypass preservation; chilled/frozen lots record actual utilities, cryogen, losses and time. Package usable product separately and exclude post-gate logistics. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `shared` | facilities and periods | Record donor phases, collection room, laboratory, incubator, refrigerator/tank and reusable container consumers and service periods once. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `reproductive_inputs` | donor management and actual in-vivo/in-vitro routes | In-vivo fertilisation precedes recovery; it does not imply absence of reproductive inputs. Include attributable inputs/services for actual artificial insemination or natural mating and actual donor reproductive treatment; in-vitro semen belongs only to laboratory fertilisation. Preserve each actual route and failed attempt; distinguish donor treatment from excluded recipient preparation/transfer. Cattle evidence establishes possible operations, not a prescription, dose or success rate for other species. | `fao-cattle-embryo-superovulation` |

| `recovery` | Embryo collection or oocyte retrieval | required | one route per lot | Independent removal of intended raw material from donor context | recovered embryo or oocyte count |
| `preparation` | First preparation or in-vitro production | required | route-specific steps | Raw-to-prepared embryo handoff, with in-vitro fertilisation/culture only when selected | prepared embryo count |
| `grading` | Grade and destination sorting | required | every prepared lot | Accepted, downgraded, held and rejected states | count by grade and destination |

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Donor insemination semen (`donor_insemination_semen`)

Record only actual artificial insemination in the in-vivo route; reconcile species, donor, semen lot, dose specification and used quantity without duplicating laboratory ivf_semen. Convert doses to volume only with measured lot-specific dose volume; do not assume dose equivalence.

- Selected flow: Donor insemination semen (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Dose count / dose
- Amount rule: Retain attributable raw quantities and units under cp_reproductive_inputs; normalize once to accepted final output of the same scope under inventory_reference_normalization and stage_throughput_linkage.

- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`)

###### Donor natural mating service (`donor_mating_service`)

Record only actual natural mating; attribute breeding-male husbandry/service burden or verify complete coverage by purchased service. Retain failed events and the actual service period; do not additionally charge semen for insemination that did not occur. Define each service, donor and species; service count is not successful conception count.

- Selected flow: Donor natural mating service (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Service count / service
- Amount rule: Retain attributable raw quantities and units under cp_reproductive_inputs; normalize once to accepted final output of the same scope under inventory_reference_normalization and stage_throughput_linkage.

###### Donor reproductive treatment inputs (`donor_reproductive_treatment`)

Conditional collection role, not one fixed drug flow. Under cp_reproductive_inputs record each actually used formulation, active ingredient, concentration, formulated quantity, diluent, consumable and service separately; instantiate zero, one or multiple verified concrete exchanges without combining different drugs or units. Evidence may establish non-use; no universal superovulation requirement, prescription or default dose is imposed across species.

- Selected flow: Donor reproductive treatment inputs (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Actual product property / native unit
- Amount rule: Retain attributable raw quantities and units under cp_reproductive_inputs; normalize once to accepted final output of the same scope under inventory_reference_normalization and stage_throughput_linkage.

Measure species-specific feed for the donor's attributable service period.

Denominator and scope requirements：per released embryo

Raw quantity and calculation requirements: Use separate feed-supply, intake and loss ledgers under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. The quantity carrying feed-production burden includes in-boundary refusals, spoilage and uneaten feed; it is not reduced to animal intake. Retain source, species/cohort, phase and original mass/moisture basis. Calculate the final contribution with inventory_reference_normalization and stage_throughput_linkage exactly once. Original collection denominator kind: reference_flow.

- Selected flow: Donor feed (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg dry matter

- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_donor`
QA scope for this card: the intake range below screens only separately recorded biological intake on its stated unit and denominator, reconstructed under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. It does not bound or substitute for the supplied-feed exchange, which retains in-boundary uneaten losses and their production burden. Do not compare feed supply with intake bounds or subtract losses merely to fit a range. A supply-specific range requires separate evidence; missing intake/loss records leave this intake QA unassessed, not passing.

  - Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`)
  - Lower: 0
  - Upper: 100000
  - Unit: kg dry matter per released embryo
  - Basis: donor-period intake divided by linked released embryos; QA variable is recorded biological intake only, not the supplied-feed inventory amount

###### Direct manure nitrous oxide to air (`review_donor_direct_n2o`)

Use the actual manure-management nitrogen pathway. Keep storage/treatment distinct from field application and grazing deposition, which require a managed-soil method and an explicitly assigned inventory responsibility. Applies only to the operated `donor` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

###### Manure ammonia to air (`review_donor_nh3`)

Use actual species, housing/storage conditions and a justified nitrogen-flow method. Track total N and ammoniacal N by stage; a generic volatilised-N estimate is not automatically NH3 because it may include other nitrogen species. Applies only to the operated `donor` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete.

###### Released viable embryo (`viable_embryo`)

This is the sole reference product; no transfer or pregnancy outcome is implied.

Raw reference-output records: Count signed quality-released embryos by route, state and grade. Preserve the measured accepted lot quantity and every required qualifier. The amount below is the normalized reference exchange, not an assertion that a physical lot contains only one unit.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

### Allocation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `subdivide` | all lots | Subdivide by species, donor, in-vivo/in-vitro route, final state and grade before any residual allocation; include failed attempts. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `destinations` | graded output | Accepted reference-grade embryos, independently sold downgraded embryos, held states and treatment rejects require distinct actual handoffs. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `periods` | donor and laboratory | Attribute feed, donor events, collection, culture, storage and replacement/cull to observed service periods and lot outputs once; do not double-allocate across years. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `assets` | shared facilities | Assign measured service hours/occupancy of rooms, incubators, tanks and reusable containers to all consuming nodes and periods once; disclose residual physical/economic split and sensitivity. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `allocation_method_basis` | Residual joint burdens and shared service | Apply the general LCA hierarchy: examine subdivision or an appropriately justified system expansion before residual allocation; then prefer a supported physical causal relationship, and justify an economic basis when physical attribution is not established. The donor-day, occupancy or throughput driver is a PCR modelling choice requiring case-specific evidence and sensitivity, not a requirement of sanitary guidance. Include failed attempts and losses in the service period; do not select only successful outputs or introduce hypothetical substitution credits. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |

| `count_balance` | recovery through release | Reconcile route-specific raw embryo or oocyte, prepared, graded, downgraded, held, rejected, preserved and released counts; retain failed events. | `cp_recovery`, `cp_lab`, `cp_grade`, `cp_preserve`, `cp_release` | lot-level count balance | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `donor_intensity` | donor service | Divide attributable same-period donor burden by linked released embryos after real independent-output treatment. | `cp_donor`, `cp_recovery`, `cp_release` | donor burden per embryo | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `route_intensity` | laboratory and preservation | Divide actual route/state media, semen, energy, cryogen and storage burden by same-route/state accepted count, retaining zero-output lots. | `cp_lab`, `cp_preserve`, `cp_release` | route inventory per embryo | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `shared_service` | shared infrastructure | Assign each asset's observed service over all consuming nodes and periods once; reconciled shares equal total service. | `cp_donor`, `cp_recovery`, `cp_lab`, `cp_preserve`, `cp_release` | unique attributed service burden | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `donor` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `donor_feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `review_donor_direct_n2o`; `review_donor_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_operating_utilities` | all actual operated nodes | Obtain raw use by node/carrier; attribute shared meters using evidenced usage with all consumer shares reconciling to the total. Retain electricity kWh, purchased heat MJ and each fuel native unit separately; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ is only an energy-unit conversion, not electricity/heat substitution or efficiency. Count inputs covered by a service dataset once. Each other actual carrier requires its own concrete exchange or named covering service; absence from the existing cards is not an exclusion. Apply existing foreground-emission responsibility rules to on-site combustion. Normalize attributable totals exactly once under the existing normalization rules; attribute zero-output failed batches to an evidenced same-scope service period rather than divide by zero or discard them. Missing metering, attribution or coverage evidence remains a gap and prevents a completeness claim. | `cp_operating_utilities` | quantities and coverage by node and carrier per reference flow | |
| `calc_reproductive_inputs` | `donor_insemination_semen`; `donor_mating_service`; `donor_reproductive_treatment` | Obtain each quantity/service from actual donor events, retaining failed events and in-boundary loss burdens; reconcile unused returns to actual destinations. Link an evidenced same-scope service period to accepted released embryos, then normalize each attributable native-unit quantity once; never divide zero-output events by zero or discard their burdens. Formulation mass is not active-ingredient mass; IU cannot be converted to kg without evidence. Do not duplicate inputs already covered by a named service; attribute in-vivo and in-vitro semen separately. | `cp_reproductive_inputs`; `cp_release` | separate actual input quantities per released embryo | `fao-cattle-embryo-superovulation` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity` | released product | Preserve species, donor, route, developmental stage, grade, state, container and gate. | grade sheet and signed release |
| `completeness` | all attempts | Include failed retrieval/culture, samples, downgrade, rejection, utilities and packaging. | reconciled event and lot registers |
| `temporal` | donor and assets | Link service, replacement, room/incubator/tank use and released embryos to observed periods. | dated husbandry and asset logs |
| `comparability` | route and state | Retain separate in-vivo/in-vitro and fresh/chilled/frozen denominators; no universal success factor. | route-specific release criteria and ledger |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference` | final product | Require viable animal embryo, species, route, stage, grade, state and signed release; an anatomical structure cannot substitute for the product flow. | `un-cpc-3`; `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `route` | each lot | Resolve one in-vivo or in-vitro path and only actual fertilisation/culture, preservation and trade controls. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `balance` | every interface | Reconcile raw, prepared, graded, downgraded, preserved, rejected and released counts plus media and packages. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `attribution` | periods/assets | Verify donor and failed-event periods, every shared consumer, unique burden ownership and independent lower-grade handover. | `woah-invivo-2024`; `woah-invitro-2024` |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `donor` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `v_operating_utilities` | all actual operated nodes, including non-chilled/non-frozen routes | Reconcile cp_operating_utilities against every actual node/carrier: require measured/evidenced estimated use with a concrete exchange, a named service dataset explicitly covering it in full, or evidenced inapplicability. Check that added operating-electricity cards, existing preservation/separation energy cards and service datasets do not duplicate burdens. Fresh routes and nodes without an existing energy card are not assumed energy-free. This is a dataset-production review requirement; a PCR structural check does not prove actual completeness. | |
| `v_reproductive_inputs` | actual donor route | Reconcile every actual insemination/mating and reproductive treatment to concrete quantities/exchanges under the donor roles or a named service with complete coverage. Evidence is required for non-use; missing records, unresolved UUIDs and failed events are not zero inputs. The laboratory-only ivf_semen card cannot justify excluding in-vivo semen. Unresolved drug/service identity or quantity prevents a complete dataset claim and unverified final exchange creation. | `fao-cattle-embryo-superovulation` |
