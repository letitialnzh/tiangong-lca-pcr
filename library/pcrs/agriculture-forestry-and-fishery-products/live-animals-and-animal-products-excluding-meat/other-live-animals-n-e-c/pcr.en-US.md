# Other live animals, n.e.c.

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Legally supplied living animals not assigned to a more specific class: eligible amphibians, non-bee insects including living silkworms, spiders, scorpions, worms and leeches. Each dataset fixes one species, life stage, source route, condition and handover gate. Exclude bees, separately classified birds, mammals or reptiles, dead edible insects, silkworm cocoons, dead animals and aquatic goods assigned elsewhere. The residual class does not license capture or trade.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.live-animals-and-animal-products-excluding-meat.other-live-animals-n-e-c |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 02199 |
| covered_products | Eligible living amphibians, non-bee insects, spiders, scorpions, worms and leeches after species-specific classification review. |
| excluded_products | Bees; separately classified live vertebrates; dead edible insects; silkworm cocoons; dead animals; aquatic goods elsewhere; illegal sources. |
| representative_product | One species- and life-stage-qualified living lot at actual source handover. |
| production_route | Managed breeding/rearing or demonstrably lawful wild live capture, then live selection and species-appropriate holding/handover; purchased stock retains upstream burden. |
| market_state | Living viable animals in declared life stage and holding condition. |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | One declared living species and life stage, not an undifferentiated animal mixture. |
| How much | 1 kg measured live animal biomass excluding removable water, substrate and container. |
| How well | Species, classification, life stage, count or population estimate, viability, wet-mass method, holding medium, source legality and gate. |
| How long or cycle | Actual cohort or collection event and nonoverlapping production, service and replacement periods. |
| reference_flow_link | `product` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Species-, stage- and gate-qualified living animal |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Mass unit group `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | species; classification decision; life stage; count or population estimate; viability; wet-mass method; holding medium; legal source; route; gate; period |

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| m_net | reference product | Mass | kg | Use calibrated net live-animal mass; exclude removable water, substrate and container. |
| m_count | each lot | Count and Mass | count and kg | Report count or documented population estimate; convert only using measured lot mass, never a universal larva/adult factor. |
| m_period | cohort and shared assets | Time | period | Link actual inputs, outputs, deaths, services and replacement to unique nonoverlapping periods. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. These are final foreground-package contributions, not replacements for stage quantitative references or stage-native unit-process datasets. Retain stage records separately. Compute normalized amount = attributable raw amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final reference-output quantity. Apply normalization exactly once. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |

| starting_condition_role | Rearing and wild capture are exclusive source nodes; no fictional route. |
| product_classification_scope | Eligible living animals only, after exclusion of more specific live classes and non-live goods. |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased same-category live animals retain supplier burden and enter only the performed downstream node; do not recreate their breeding or capture. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier burden and provenance, species-specific input supply and legal capture evidence. |
| disclosure | Species, stage, count, net mass, holding medium, legal source, mortalities, side outputs, periods, shared services and actual gate. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b_scope | each lot | Verify eligible living species and legal source; exclude bees, cocoons, dead edible insects and separately classified aquatic/vertebrate goods. | un-cpc-2025 |
| b_route | source | Rearing and lawful wild capture are distinct exclusive nodes; purchased live stock keeps supplier burden and enters only actual downstream work. | un-cpc-2025 |
| b_gate | handover | End after live selection and species-appropriate holding at actual source gate; exclude later transport, use and dead-goods processing. | un-cpc-2025 |
| b_period | assets and periods | Assign cohort establishment, shared room/tank and replacement once to actual consuming node and period. | mass-balance-identity |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rear | Managed species-specific rearing | conditional | Managed route only; not wild capture | Raise declared stock through actual stages; hand viable cohort to selection. | per kg node output |
| capture | Independent lawful live capture | conditional | Permitted wild route only; not rearing | Remove live animals from documented wild source; hand viable lot to selection. | per kg node output |
| select | Live selection and holding | required | Every route, actual intervention only | Check species, stage and viability; split accepted animals, independently sold outputs and loss. | per kg node output |
| gate | Contained source-gate handover | required | Every marketed live lot | Protect and hand over measured live product at the actual source gate. | per kg node output |

These are responsibilities rather than universal technologies. Amphibian aquatic/terrestrial stages, insect metamorphosis and worm substrate occur only for an actual declared species and route.

###### Viable live product at source gate (`product`)

Weigh net living animal biomass at actual source gate; verify count and lawful transfer.

Raw reference-output records: Weigh net living animal biomass at actual source gate; verify count and lawful transfer. Preserve the measured accepted lot quantity and every required qualifier. The amount below is the normalized reference exchange, not an assertion that a physical lot contains only one unit.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

### Allocation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a_output | co-products and residues | Identify every independently sold output and its handover; do not turn death, spent substrate or unsold eggs into co-products. Prefer documented physical causality for shared inputs; otherwise allocate by measured net economic value for the node and period with price basis and sensitivity disclosed. Meter shared rooms, tanks, lighting and equipment where possible, else use animal-days or area-time, assigning each service once to consuming nodes and nonoverlapping periods. | mass-balance-identity |
| a_period | periods | Record each cohort stage and asset service period; assign establishment, deaths and replacement once, without repeating stock or burden across periods. | mass-balance-identity |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c_net | reference lot | Net live mass = gross weighed mass − removable medium and container tare. | calibrated gross, tare, viability | kg | mass-balance-identity |
| c_stock | cohort | Opening + additions − deaths − sales − closing = explained stage-wise balance. | stock, mortality, sale ledgers | kg;count | mass-balance-identity |
| c_shared | shared service | Node burden = total metered service × documented node-use share; shares sum to 1. | meters, animal-days or area-time, period | kg;kWh | mass-balance-identity |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q_core | each lot | Require species/stage identity, legal provenance, calibrated net biomass, count, opening/closing stock, deaths, inputs, separate sales, shared-service ledger and period linkage. Missing lawful provenance or valid live-mass measurement blocks a dataset. | classification, permit, calibrated weighing and stock ledger |
| q_range | all flow cards | Provisional QA screens trigger review, never override measurements or define publication-allowed ranges. | raw records and exception notes |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v_identity | reference | Verify species, stage, legality, living state, count, net mass and gate; do not claim fixed UUID without detail and support-row verification. | un-cpc-2025 |
| v_balance | nodes and periods | Reconcile inputs, sales, deaths, waste and closing stock by stage; do not count one animal or loss at two handovers. | mass-balance-identity |
| v_alloc | outputs and shared services | Check each intended product and own handover, allocation basis, period and shared service shares summing to 1. | mass-balance-identity |
| v_route | conditional routes | Unpermitted wild collection is not a legal source; no fictitious breeding for wild route or zero upstream burden for purchased stock. | un-cpc-2025 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Species- and route-specific live-animal foreground package |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| allowed_use | Species- and route-specific secondary/background dataset only for the declared live source gate; do not generalize across amphibians, insects and arachnids or convert to dead goods without new data. |
| excluded_use | Other species, stages, sources, dead goods, post-gate transport and use without new data. |
| required_metadata | species; classification decision; life stage; count or population estimate; viability; wet-mass method; holding medium; legal source; route; gate; period; method, period and allocation disclosure |
