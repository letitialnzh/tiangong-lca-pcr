# Non-bovine semen for breeding

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers usable breeding semen from animals other than bovines, including sheep and goats, at collection/processing-centre release. Fresh, chilled and frozen states require separate lot records. Bovine semen (CPC 02411), embryos, live donors, insemination services and downstream distribution are excluded. Species-specific veterinary and trade measures apply only where relevant; they are not universal LCA factors.

## 2. Product Category Identity

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted_count` | reference output | accepted count | dose | Count only released doses passing the documented species-specific acceptance specification. |
| `liquid_balance` | collected semen and diluent | calibrated volume and concentration | mL; sperm/mL | Reconcile raw volume, preparation medium, rejected material and filled dose count; volume alone does not establish dose equivalence. |
| `state_partition` | final product | accepted count by state | dose | Fresh, chilled and frozen denominators remain separate unless a documented comparison conversion is supplied. |
| `period_link` | donor and shared services | duration and accepted output | donor-day; dose | Link dated inputs, events and asset use to the donor and batch periods without duplicate annualization. |
| `accepted_item_count` | reference product and its output card | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | item | The machine unit item is the local representation of the confirmed unit-group reference unit Item(s), with multiplier 1. One item means one quality-accepted breeding dose of the declared species, state, grade and release specification. Preserve native dose counts in collection records. This count representation does not equate containers, volume, sperm count, oocytes or treatment attempts to accepted goods, and does not establish equivalence across species, states or dose specifications. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. These are final foreground-package contributions, not replacements for stage quantitative references or stage-native unit-process datasets. Retain stage records separately. Compute normalized amount = attributable raw amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final reference-output quantity. Apply normalization exactly once. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Species-specific feed (`feed`)

Record feed supply, measured intake and losses for eligible donor maintenance over the recorded period; intake is not the upstream feed inventory.

Denominator and scope requirements：per linked accepted dose

Raw quantity and calculation requirements: Use separate feed-supply, intake and loss ledgers under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. The quantity carrying feed-production burden includes in-boundary refusals, spoilage and uneaten feed; it is not reduced to animal intake. Retain source, species/cohort, phase and original mass/moisture basis. Calculate the final contribution with inventory_reference_normalization and stage_throughput_linkage exactly once. Original collection denominator kind: reference_flow.

- Selected flow: Feed and forage for identified non-bovine donor (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Dry matter mass / kg
- Amount rule: Calculate the attributable final-package exchange under inventory_reference_normalization and stage_throughput_linkage using reconciled feed-supply records that retain in-boundary losses and their production burden.
- Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_donor`
QA scope for this card: the intake range below screens only separately recorded biological intake on its stated unit and denominator, reconstructed under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. It does not bound or substitute for the supplied-feed exchange, which retains in-boundary uneaten losses and their production burden. Do not compare feed supply with intake bounds or subtract losses merely to fit a range. A supply-specific range requires separate evidence; missing intake/loss records leave this intake QA unassessed, not passing.

###### Direct manure nitrous oxide to air (`review_donor_direct_n2o`)

Use the actual manure-management nitrogen pathway. Keep storage/treatment distinct from field application and grazing deposition, which require a managed-soil method and an explicitly assigned inventory responsibility. Applies only to the operated `donor` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete.

###### Manure ammonia to air (`review_donor_nh3`)

Use actual species, housing/storage conditions and a justified nitrogen-flow method. Track total N and ammoniacal N by stage; a generic volatilised-N estimate is not automatically NH3 because it may include other nitrogen species. Applies only to the operated `donor` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions.

###### Released breeding dose (`released_dose`)

The sole reference product is quality-accepted non-bovine breeding semen at centre handover.

Raw reference-output records: Count accepted units by species, grade and final state and link volume and sperm count. Preserve the measured accepted lot quantity and every required qualifier. The amount below is the normalized reference exchange, not an assertion that a physical lot contains only one unit.

The machine unit item is the local representation of the confirmed unit-group reference unit Item(s), with multiplier 1. One item means one quality-accepted breeding dose of the declared species, state, grade and release specification. Preserve native dose counts in collection records. This count representation does not equate containers, volume, sperm count, oocytes or treatment attempts to accepted goods, and does not establish equivalence across species, states or dose specifications.

| `shared_service` | housing, collection apparatus, lab and cooling | Enumerate consumers and service periods, then assign each burden once by measured occupancy, usage time or another justified causal service basis. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `quality_outputs` | grading and filling | Downgraded material is a co-product only with independent legal handover; otherwise treat rejects as waste. Disclose any causal or physical/economic allocation decision and sensitivity. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `mixed_state` | fresh, chilled and frozen | Assign common donor/collection burden to actual accepted lots using documented causal service or counts; preserve state-specific energy, cryogen and loss for applicable lots only. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `allocation_method_basis` | Residual joint burdens and shared service | Apply the general LCA hierarchy: examine subdivision or an appropriately justified system expansion before residual allocation; then prefer a supported physical causal relationship, and justify an economic basis when physical attribution is not established. The donor-day, occupancy or throughput driver is a PCR modelling choice requiring case-specific evidence and sensitivity, not a requirement of sanitary guidance. Include failed attempts and losses in the service period; do not select only successful outputs or introduce hypothetical substitution credits. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dose_yield` | collection through release | Reconcile raw volume and concentration with graded states, prepared bulk, fill and release counts; accepted released doses divided by linked donor period. | donor, lot, liquid, quality and dose records | accepted yield and loss ledger | `woah-semen-hygiene-2024` |
| `service_share` | donor and shared assets | Period burden times evidenced service share divided by accepted linked dose count; disclose unproductive periods and reject zero denominators. | dated inputs, service duration, linked doses | burden per dose | `woah-semen-hygiene-2024` |
| `state_burden` | preservation | State-specific metered power, cryogen and rejects divided only by accepted doses in that state. | lot state, meter, supply and acceptance | fresh, chilled or frozen inventory | `fao-cryoconservation-2012` |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `donor` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `review_donor_direct_n2o`; `review_donor_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_operating_utilities` | all actual operated nodes | Obtain raw use by node/carrier; attribute shared meters using evidenced usage with all consumer shares reconciling to the total. Retain electricity kWh, purchased heat MJ and each fuel native unit separately; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ is only an energy-unit conversion, not electricity/heat substitution or efficiency. Count inputs covered by a service dataset once. Each other actual carrier requires its own concrete exchange or named covering service; absence from the existing cards is not an exclusion. Apply existing foreground-emission responsibility rules to on-site combustion. Normalize attributable totals exactly once under the existing normalization rules; attribute zero-output failed batches to an evidenced same-scope service period rather than divide by zero or discard them. Missing metering, attribution or coverage evidence remains a gap and prevents a completeness claim. | `cp_operating_utilities` | quantities and coverage by node and carrier per reference flow | |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity` | reference | Verify non-bovine species, breeding purpose, dose specification and centre-release gate. | donor, lot and release record |
| `completeness` | all nodes | Cover selected stages and reconcile accepted, downgraded, rejected and loss states without duplicate internal transfer. | process and balance ledger |
| `temporal` | donor and preserved lots | Align donor phase, collection, batch, hold and asset service dates. | dated registers and meters |
| `route` | state variants | Disclose fresh, chilled or frozen branch and applicable species-specific sanitary controls. | quality and preservation log |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `non_bovine` | reference | Reject bovine donor, mismatched CPC or any UUID not detail-confirmed as non-bovine breeding semen with matching gate/property. | `un-cpc-3-2025` |
| `balance` | graded-to-release chain | Reconcile liquid and discrete units across accepted, downgraded, rejected and lost states within documented measurement tolerances. | `woah-semen-hygiene-2024` |
| `branch` | final state | Require one fresh/chilled/frozen final state per lot; chilled/frozen lots need observed intervention and duration, never bovine default factors. | `fao-cryoconservation-2012` |
| `no_double_count` | donor and assets | Dated donor phases and housing, laboratory, collection and refrigeration shares must charge each service once per period. | `woah-semen-hygiene-2024` |
| `gate_quality` | release | Require donor species, count, volume, sperm specification and quality release; reject insemination/distribution activity. | `woah-semen-hygiene-2024` |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `donor` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `v_operating_utilities` | all actual operated nodes, including non-chilled/non-frozen routes | Reconcile cp_operating_utilities against every actual node/carrier: require measured/evidenced estimated use with a concrete exchange, a named service dataset explicitly covering it in full, or evidenced inapplicability. Check that added operating-electricity cards, existing preservation/separation energy cards and service datasets do not duplicate burdens. Fresh routes and nodes without an existing energy card are not assumed energy-free. This is a dataset-production review requirement; a PCR structural check does not prove actual completeness. | |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
