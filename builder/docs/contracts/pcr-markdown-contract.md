# PCR Markdown Contract

This contract defines the authored PCR Markdown shape consumed by agents and builder tooling.

## Files

Each PCR directory must contain:

- `manifest.yaml`
- `pcr.en-US.md`
- `pcr.zh-CN.md`
- `structured.yaml`

`pcr.en-US.md` is the canonical authored source. `pcr.zh-CN.md` is an aligned rendering of the same rule. New scaffolds should use the language-specific templates `builder/templates/pcr.en-US.md.hbs` and `builder/templates/pcr.zh-CN.md.hbs`.

A further declared optional language (for example `de-DE`) adds one sibling `pcr.<language>.md` file. The file name
uses the canonical BCP 47 spelling from `manifest.languages.available`. A declaration without its file is an error:
to publish without the language, remove the declaration together with the file.

For active and published PCRs, canonical English Markdown must contain authored content and declare the manifest
identity, canonical language, and bilingual relationship in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
pcr_id: <manifest.id>
language: en-US
sync_with: pcr.zh-CN.md
---
```

Chinese Markdown should translate human-facing headings, table labels, process names, explanatory notes, ordinary
prose, and flow display names. For a UUID-bearing Tiangong flow, use the exact official Chinese `baseName` returned by
a direct read when available and preserve the same UUID; do not invent a localized official name when Tiangong has
none. Stable machine-facing identifiers and controlled vocabulary values, such as `process_id`, `row_id`,
`direction`, `flow_type`, `value_mode`, `specificity`, `basis_kind`, `evidence_kind`, `source_ids`, Tiangong UUIDs,
and source ids, should remain unchanged unless the parser and vocabulary contract explicitly support a localized
equivalent.

Material Chinese Markdown must contain authored content after its YAML frontmatter. Its frontmatter must declare the
same PCR identity and the exact language relationship:

```yaml
---
pcr_id: <manifest.id>
language: zh-CN
sync_with: pcr.en-US.md
---
```

Optional language Markdown follows the same frontmatter shape, with its own declared language and `sync_with: pcr.en-US.md`. Every dependent translation is derived from the canonical English source, so a sibling locale is not an acceptable sync target:

```yaml
---
pcr_id: <manifest.id>
language: de-DE
sync_with: pcr.en-US.md
---
```

Every declared language file is read and validated: a missing file, malformed frontmatter, an empty body, a
`language` that does not match the file name, a `pcr_id` that does not match the manifest, an undeclared language
file, and a `sync_with` other than `pcr.en-US.md` are all rejected. Optional translations are not auto-generated and
are never marked reviewed automatically; they enter a release only when a reviewer marks them reviewed in
`manifest.yaml`.

Active and publication preflights reject an empty Chinese file, missing or malformed frontmatter, or any mismatch in
these three fields. They apply the same checks to every declared optional language file, plus a missing file.
Inspection checks required file types first, then reads the safe manifest to discover and preflight all declared
optional language files before reading language bodies. Symbolic links, non-regular files, unsafe reads and invalid
UTF-8 invalidate the managed-input boundary: no projection or measurement result is produced. This applies equally
to ordinary inspection and proposed-manifest previews; missing declared files remain explicit diagnostics.

## Required Sections

Material PCR Markdown must use this section order:

1. Scope and Applicability
2. Product Category Identity
3. Reference Flow
4. Measurement and Unit Rules
5. System Boundary
6. Process Inventory Structure
7. Allocation and Co-product Handling
8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules
9. Validation Rules
10. Published Dataset Profile
11. Data Sources

System Boundary, Allocation and Co-product Handling, and Validation Rules must each project at least one normative
rule for every material PCR. Before a PCR becomes active, and again at publication, English and Chinese Markdown
must project the same ordered `rule_id` sequence in all three groups. This is a structural translation check;
translated prose remains human-authored.

## Product Category Identity

The product category identity section defines the stable PCR meaning independently from any one external classification system:

```markdown
| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id |  |
| classification_refs |  |
| covered_products |  |
| excluded_products |  |
| representative_product |  |
| production_route |  |
| market_state |  |
```

For active and published PCRs, `canonical_pcr_id` is required and must exactly equal `manifest.yaml` `id`.

## Reference Flow

The reference flow section must first define the functional unit:

```markdown
| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What |  |
| How much |  |
| How well |  |
| How long or cycle |  |
| reference_flow_link |  |
```

`reference_flow_link` normally names one completed product-output row. PCRs permitting several terminal states
may declare the finite exactly-one selector documented in [Measurement and Unit Rules](../methods/measurement-unit-rules.md#explicit-terminal-output-alternatives).
Both renderings must preserve its row ids and controlled fields. The actual dataset must select one state explicitly;
an intermediate handoff quantity must never be fixed to the final reference just to satisfy a check.

The reference flow section then defines the Tiangong reference flow object:

```markdown
| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount |  |
| Reference product flow | <name> `<uuid>` |
| Reference flow property | <name> `<uuid>` |
| Reference unit group | <name> `<uuid>` |
| Reference unit |  |
| Required qualifiers | qualifier; qualifier |
```

`Required qualifiers` are category-specific descriptors that must be declared when constructing a concrete foreground data package.

## Measurement and Unit Rules

The measurement section defines rules that affect data consistency, conversion, or validation:

```markdown
| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `<uuid>` | kg | ... |
```

Rules should constrain data consistency, conversion, or validation. Ordinary units used by individual inventory rows belong in those rows.

## System Boundary

The system boundary section states the foreground data collection boundary and the boundary abstraction used for recursive product-category inputs:

```markdown
### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition |  |
| starting_condition_role |  |
| product_classification_scope |  |
| recursive_input_rule |  |
| upstream_dataset_requirement |  |
| disclosure |  |
```

`recursive_input_rule` describes how an input flow in the same product category is recorded when product-category tracing would recurse. `declared_starting_condition` and `disclosure` define the starting condition facts that the foreground data package must declare.

## Process Inventory

Process inventory must be organized as:

```markdown
### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Process: <process name> (`<process_id>`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows
##### Waste flows
##### Elementary flows

#### Outputs

##### Product flows
##### Waste flows
##### Elementary flows
```

Inventory flow rows are authored as flow cards under their process, direction, and flow-type headings. Each card heading uses a human-readable role followed by a stable `row_id` in backticks. Direction and flow type are inherited from the surrounding headings, so they should not be repeated inside the card.

Each flow card is one atomic exchange: its `Selected flow` must name exactly one physically or chemically specific
product, waste, or elementary flow that can resolve to one Tiangong flow record. Split electricity, steam or
purchased heat, each fuel, each refrigerant, water, every chemical or ingredient, every packaging material, each
waste stream, and each elementary emission into separate cards, even when their amounts share one meter or
collection protocol. Collection or selector labels such as `energy carriers`, `electricity, steam, or fuel`,
`packaging materials`, `wastewater and residues`, or `actual Tiangong utility flows` are instructions, not flows, and
must not appear as `Selected flow`. Put route applicability on the individual card and use `not_applicable` only when
that atomic exchange is demonstrably absent. If its Tiangong UUID is unresolved, keep the atomic name, omit the UUID,
and track the identity gap in manifest review metadata; never replace it with a plural category.

An authored or remediated material PCR declares the enforced contract in `manifest.yaml`:

```yaml
review_metadata:
  inventory_contract:
    atomic_flows: v1
    localized_flow_names: tiangong_zh_v1
```

With these declarations, a collection-label `Selected flow` and an untranslated human-facing English flow display in
Chinese Markdown are lint errors. Older material PCRs without the relevant declaration remain in the migration queue
and emit warnings until their bilingual inventory is split, localized, resynced, and audited; new authoring must not
omit either declaration.

```markdown
###### Washing or de-salting water supplied as product input (`washing_water`)

Washing or de-salting water is recorded when it crosses the foreground process boundary as a product input.

- Selected flow: Process water `<uuid>`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: measured water use
- Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per 1,000 kg cleaned product output
- Basis kind: Process output (`process_output`)
- Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_washing_water_records`
- Sources: `source-id`
```

`collection_protocol_id` links a foreground collected or calculated inventory row to a protocol in section 8.

Chinese Markdown should localize human-facing flow card labels:

```markdown
###### 作为产品投入的清洗或脱盐水（`washing_water`）

清洗或脱盐水作为产品输入跨越前景过程边界时记录。

- 选定流：过程水 `<uuid>`
- 流属性/单位：Mass / kg
- 数量规则：计量用水量
- 数值来源模式：前景记录（`foreground_record`）
- 适用范围：场址特定（`site_specific`）
- 归一化基准：每 1,000 kg 清洁产品输出
- 基准类型：过程输出（`process_output`）
- 证据类型：采集记录（`collected_record`）
- 采集协议：`cp_washing_water_records`
- 来源：`source-id`
```

When a quantity range is needed, keep it attached to the flow card as a separate range bullet. The range role identifies how the range is used; it is not the amount value mode. Prefer source-backed ranges, but broad provisional ranges may use `reasoned_estimate` when important flows need initial AI or author guidance and stronger evidence is not yet available:

```markdown
- Range: Water-use QA guardrail
  - Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`)
  - Lower: 0.5
  - Upper: 3.0
  - Unit: m3
  - Basis: per 1,000 kg cleaned product output
  - Basis kind: Process output (`process_output`)
  - Evidence kind: External source (`external_source`)
  - Sources: `source-id`
```

Use the same nested shape in Chinese Markdown:

```markdown
- 数量范围：用水 QA 校验范围
  - 范围角色：QA 校验（`qa_guardrail`）
  - 下限：0.5
  - 上限：3.0
  - 单位：m3
  - 基准：每 1,000 kg 清洁产品输出
  - 基准类型：过程输出（`process_output`）
  - 证据类型：外部来源（`external_source`）
  - 来源：`source-id`
```

For provisional AI or author ranges without strong evidence, omit `Sources` and mark the evidence kind explicitly:

```markdown
- 数量范围：暂定筛选估算
  - 范围角色：默认估计（`default_estimate`）
  - 下限：0.01
  - 上限：10
  - 单位：kWh/kg 干燥产品
  - 基准：每 kg 干燥产品的宽泛首轮干燥能耗估计
  - 基准类型：过程输出（`process_output`）
  - 证据类型：推理估算（`reasoned_estimate`）
```

## Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Section 8 defines how the first foreground data package is produced from real records.

```markdown
### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

## Published Dataset Profile

Section 10 defines how a completed foreground data package is described for downstream users:

```markdown
| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role |  |
| downstream_use |  |
| allowed_use |  |
| excluded_use |  |
| required_metadata |  |
| required_quality_disclosure |  |
| update_trigger |  |
```

## Data Sources

Data Sources must use stable source ids:

```markdown
| Source id | Type | Reference | Used for |
```

List external sources, standards, literature, official guidance, and non-default quantitative or method evidence. Tiangong UUID-bearing identity rows are represented by their UUIDs in the relevant PCR tables.
